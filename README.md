# Task Timer

A simple React Native project built on an Expo Snack that helps you focus on a specific task at hand for up to 20 minutes (at the moment). The first step is to input the task to be focused on, then trasitioning to deciding on how long to focus on the task. It uses preset timers to quickly setup your focus session that can be paused or played at any moment during the focus session. 

The app can store all of your focus sessions and renders them everytime you open up the app (until you decide to clear the history) using the devices local storage. The task history is displayed in a different colour depending on whether the task was initially completed or was cancelled prior to the timer running out.

## What I learnt
The app has taught me the following React Native concepts:
- Handling state
- Component design
- Implementing local storage
- Conditional rendering
- JavaScript shortcircuting
- Styling using Flex
- Handling side effects

## Next stages
What I plan on doing further for this app:
- Implement custom time functionality
- Change the Status Bar colour
